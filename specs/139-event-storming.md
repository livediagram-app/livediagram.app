# Event storming

A new diagram type under the picker's **Technical** category: the
sticky-note workshop notation for exploring a business domain
(Brandolini's event storming). It is deliberately being built
**incrementally** — the template shipped first as a near-blank starter
so the type exists end-to-end (picker card, preview tile, builder,
catalogue counts), and the notation grows on top of it in phases. The
working plan lives in [`plans/event-storming.md`](../plans/event-storming.md).

## Why a template, not a new surface

livediagram's "diagram types" are template kinds
(`packages/templates/src/templates.ts`): a `TemplateKind`, a catalogue
entry, a pure element builder, a preview tile, and per-kind canvas
overrides. Event storming fits that mould exactly — it is ordinary
elements (stickies, text, arrows, frames) arranged by a convention, so
it inherits every editor feature (realtime, layers, comments, export)
for free. Nothing in the editor branches on the kind after creation.

## Phase 1 (shipped): the starter

- `TemplateKind` `'event-storming'`, title **Event storming**, an
  `extra` in the **Technical** category.
- The seed is the method's opening move and nothing else: three orange
  domain-event stickies (past tense — "Order placed", "Payment
  received", "Order shipped"), gently tilted so they read as
  hand-placed, above a muted one-line reminder of the rule ("Domain
  events · past tense · left to right in time order"). Builder:
  `packages/templates/src/template-builders-eventstorming.ts`.
- **Colour is the notation.** Orange MEANS domain event, so the
  stickies carry an explicit `fillColor` (`#fdba74`). Stickies are
  exempt from theme recolouring, so the semantics survive every theme;
  any non-sticky notation added later must pin its fill with
  `themeLockFill` for the same reason.
- **Dot-grid backdrop**, not the technical templates' graph paper: an
  event-storming board is a sticky-note workshop like the user story /
  affinity maps, which pin `grid`.
- Preview tile: three orange stickies marching along a faint dashed
  timeline arrow (`template-preview-4.tsx`).

## Still ahead (phased, see the plan)

The colour grammar beyond orange (commands, actors, policies, read
models, external systems, hotspots), a palette home for those sticky
kinds, richer template variants (big-picture vs process-level), and
whatever else the plan surfaces. Each phase lands with its own spec
update here — this file stays the source of truth for what the type
IS at any moment.

## Counts

The catalogue is pinned at **48 templates (10 default + 38 extra)** —
`templates.test.ts`, spec/09, spec/16, spec/23, the marketing FAQ +
landing copy, and the help centre's templates article all moved
together with this addition.
